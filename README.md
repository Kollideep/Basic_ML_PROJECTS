*****Basic Machine Learning Projects******  

This repository contains beginner-friendly **Machine Learning projects** that walk through from: -
1. Data Collection & Exploration- Collection of data and exploring the features; 
2. Data Preprocessing - Handling noise data(i.e null values, missing values), feature scaling(Normalization/Standardization) ;
3. Model Training - Choose the model and then Train the model ;
4. Model Evalutaion - Based on the model evslution differs if  Regression: MSE, RMSE, R² score, Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.  ;
5. Results & Insights - Comparsion of Predicted values and Actual values , Visualize performance with graphs.  

### KNN for House Price Prediction  
- **Problem**: Predict the price of a house based on features such as area, number of rooms, and location.  
- **Algorithm**: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for regression.  
- **Workflow**:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization).  
  - Splitting into training and test sets.  
  - Implementing KNN from scratch and using `scikit-learn`.  
  - Evaluating performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.  
- **Outcome**: Learned how distance-based regression models work and how feature scaling impacts performance.  


### Linear Regression for Iris Classification  
- **Problem**: Classify iris flowers into species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) using flower measurements.  
- **Algorithm**: **Linear Regression (adapted for classification)**.  
- **Workflow**:  
  - Dataset exploration and visualization (scatter plots, pair plots).  
  - Data preprocessing (standardization, label encoding).  
  - Training and testing the model.  
  - Evaluating with metrics like **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix**.  
- **Outcome**: Understood how regression techniques can be extended to handle classification tasks, and the limitations of linear models on non-linear data.
